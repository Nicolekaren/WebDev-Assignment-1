    <h3>Films/Movies</h3>
    <p>I would say a good film is one that leaves an impression in your mind for some time and makes you think or feel a certain kind of way. It can be the aesthetics, the plot, soundtrack, or a combination of all three. Some of the films that have accomplished this for me and that I would even consider "classics" are in the following list: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Her</li>
        <li>Submarine</li>
        <li>Casablanca</li>
        <li>LadyBird</li>
      </ul>
